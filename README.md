# requestsyncmanager

A sample app that uses the requestsync-manager API at navigator.syncManager.

Shows a list of all sync registrations across apps.

Only available for FirefoxOS master (as of February 2015), and only for certified apps.

Clone this repo and then it can be installed via the WebIDE onto a device that is running latest master b2g/gaia code.

See the manifest.webapp and js/main.js for how the API is used.
